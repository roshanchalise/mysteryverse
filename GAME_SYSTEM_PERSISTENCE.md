# Mystery Verse Game System - Persistence Requirements

## Overview
All verses in the Mystery Verse puzzle game must implement localStorage persistence to ensure continuous gameplay across browser sessions.

## Core Persistence Requirements

### 1. **Mandatory for All Verses**
Every interactive game/puzzle must:
- Save game state automatically after significant progress
- Restore game state on page load/refresh
- Clear saved state on game completion
- Clear saved state on manual reset

### 2. **What Must Be Persisted**

#### For Memory Games (Simon):
- Current round number
- Win streak count
- Current pattern (if mid-round)
- Player input progress
- Game active status

#### For Matching Games (Symbol Matching):
- Symbol layout/positions
- Meaning layout/positions
- Completed matches
- Game completion status

#### For Tile Games (Mahjong):
- Board state/tile positions
- Matched tiles
- Selected tiles
- Game completion status
- Mismatch detection progress

#### For Logic Puzzles:
- Current puzzle state
- User input/progress
- Solution attempts
- Hint usage

### 3. **Implementation Pattern**

All game components should follow this pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Load saved state on component initialization
const loadGameState = () => {
  try {
    const savedState = localStorage.getItem('game-verse{X}-state');
    if (savedState) {
      return JSON.parse(savedState);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to load game state:', error);
  }
  return defaultState;
};

// 2. Save state automatically when game state changes
const saveGameState = useCallback(() => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem('game-verse{X}-state', JSON.stringify(gameState));
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to save game state:', error);
  }
}, [gameState]);

// 3. Auto-save with useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  saveGameState();
}, [saveGameState]);

// 4. Clear state on completion/reset
const clearGameState = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('game-verse{X}-state');
};
```

### 4. **Storage Keys**
Use consistent naming convention:
- Verse 1 (Simon): `simon-verse1-state`
- Verse 2 (Symbol Matching): `symbol-matching-verse2-state`
- Verse 3 (Mahjong): `mahjong-verse3-state`
- Verse 4 (Logic): `logic-verse4-state`
- etc.

### 5. **User Experience Goals**

#### Player Should NEVER Lose Progress:
- ✅ Start puzzle, make progress, refresh browser → Continue where left off
- ✅ Mid-game browser crash → Resume game state on return
- ✅ Accidentally close tab → Reopen and continue playing
- ✅ Network interruption → Local state preserved

#### Fresh Start Options:
- ✅ "Try Again" button clears state and starts new game
- ✅ Game completion clears state automatically
- ✅ Manual reset creates fresh challenge

### 6. **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to default state if localStorage fails
- Console warnings for debugging (not user-facing errors)
- Corruption detection and automatic reset

### 7. **Testing Requirements**

Each verse must pass these tests:
1. **Mid-Game Refresh**: Start game, make progress, refresh → Should continue
2. **Completion Reset**: Complete game → Should clear saved state
3. **Manual Reset**: Use "Try Again" → Should clear saved state and start fresh
4. **Error Recovery**: Corrupt localStorage → Should reset gracefully

## Implementation Status

| Verse | Game Type | Persistence Status | Storage Key |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Simon Memory | ✅ Implemented | `simon-verse1-state` |
| 2 | Symbol Matching | ✅ Implemented | `symbol-matching-verse2-state` |
| 3 | Mahjong Tiles | ✅ Implemented | `mahjong-verse3-state` |
| 4 | Logic Puzzle | ⚠️ Needs Implementation | `logic-verse4-state` |

## Benefits

### For Players:
- **Continuous Experience**: Never lose progress due to technical issues
- **Flexible Gaming**: Can pause and resume at any time
- **Reduced Frustration**: No need to restart complex puzzles
- **Natural Flow**: Seamless continuation across sessions

### For Developers:
- **Consistent UX**: All verses behave predictably
- **User Retention**: Players more likely to complete difficult puzzles
- **Quality Standard**: Professional game experience
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for advanced features

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions:
- **Cloud Sync**: Save progress to user accounts
- **Multiple Save Slots**: Allow multiple game states
- **Progress Analytics**: Track completion times and attempts
- **Achievement System**: Persistent unlock tracking

This persistence system ensures that the Mystery Verse game provides a professional, frustration-free experience where players can focus on solving puzzles rather than worrying about losing progress.
