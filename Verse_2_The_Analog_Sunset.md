### **Puzzle Title:** The Analog Sunset

### **Story**

> Leo rummaged through a dusty old box in his attic, a wave of nostalgia washing over him. "Here it is!" he exclaimed, holding up a scratched DVD case for the 2000s blockbuster, *'Cyber Voyager'*. He was so excited to show the classic sci-fi film to his younger cousin, Zara. But when he plugged in his old player, the screen just flickered: "ERROR".
>
> Zara tilted her head. "A disc? Why don't we just... you know... watch it now?" She tapped her smart TV, and a familiar grid of colorful app icons appeared. Leo was baffled. He had the movie right here in his hand, but it was useless. To watch it, he had to embrace a completely new way.

## Game Logic and Feedback

### **Correct Answer:** `STREAM`

* **Feedback Animation:** The DVD player clue fades out, and the smart TV clue becomes brighter. A digital "stream" of light flows from the cloud icon to the TV.
* **Feedback Text:** "That's it! **STREAM**! You've helped Leo bridge the gap between old and new. He and Zara are now happily watching *'Cyber Voyager'* in glorious HD. Adapting to change can be an upgrade!"
* **Reward:** +100 Points. Unlocks next puzzle.

### **Incorrect Answer**

* **Feedback Sound:** A soft, gentle "bloop" sound.
* **Feedback Text:** "Not quite. Look at the clues again. Itâ€™s not just about being online; it's about how the movie *gets* to the screen without a physical object. Try again!"
