        description: "Leo rummaged through a dusty old box in his attic, a wave of nostalgia washing over him. \"Here it is!\" he exclaimed, holding up a scratched DVD case for the 2000s blockbuster, 'Cyber Voyager'. He was so excited to show the classic sci-fi film to his younger cousin, Zara. But when he plugged in his old player, the screen just flickered: \"ERROR\".\n\nZara tilted her head. \"A disc? Why don't we just... you know... watch it now?\" She tapped her smart TV, and a familiar grid of colorful app icons appeared. Leo was baffled. He had the movie right here in his hand, but it was useless. To watch it, he had to embrace a completely new way.\n\nLeo needs to adapt to the modern way of watching movies. What single word describes this necessary leap forward?",
