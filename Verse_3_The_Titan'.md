## Verse 3: The Titan's Gift

### Description of Problem

The Titan Prometheus gifted fire to humanity, a flame of knowledge and warmth that forever changed our destiny. But every flame casts a shadow, every gift carries a weight. Some burdens, like the Titan's own, feel too heavy to carry alone. They fester in silence, growing heavier in the dark. Your challenge is to decipher the wisdom hidden in this ancient tale. Look at the symbolsâ€”one of an immense weight, the other of division and connection. What single word unlocks the secret to easing such a burden?

### Visual Clues

1.  **Clue 1:** An image of the Titan **Atlas**, straining as he holds the celestial spheres (the world) on his shoulders.

2.  **Clue 2:** A simple diagram of two overlapping circles (a **Venn diagram**), with the intersecting area highlighted.

### Player Challenge

The player is presented with the story of a hidden burden and the two visual clues. They must connect the concept of a heavy, personal weight (Atlas) with the idea of creating a common, overlapping area with someone else (Venn diagram). The goal is to find the single verb that solves this metaphorical equation.

### Solution & Logic

*   **Solution Word:** `SHARE`

*   **Explanation:**
    *   **Connection to Clues:**
        *   **Atlas (Clue 1):** Represents the immense emotional burden or stress one person is carrying alone.
        *   **Venn Diagram (Clue 2):** Visually represents the act of sharingâ€”creating an overlapping, common space where something that was once separate is now held jointly.
    *   **Connection to Theme:** The core of communicating emotional stress to a friend is to **share** the burden. You are inviting them into your personal space (your circle) to help hold the weight (what's in the intersecting area).
    *   **Connection to Story:** Prometheus **shared** fire with humanity. This is the central, driving action of the famous myth used in the marketing hook.

### Feedback to Player

*   **Correct Answer:** "The flame brightens when divided! You have understood the Titan's wisdom. The answer is **SHARE**. A burden is halved when another helps to carry it. Your path forward is illuminated."

*   **Incorrect Answer:** "The weight is great, but it need not be yours alone. Look again at the symbols. How can two separate circles hold something in common? How is a burden lessened?"
